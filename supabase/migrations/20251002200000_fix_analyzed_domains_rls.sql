  # Fix RLS Policies for analyzed_domains Table

  ## Problem
  The analyzed_domains table had RLS policies requiring Supabase Auth (auth.uid()),
  but this application uses wallet-based authentication without Supabase Auth.
  This caused INSERT operations to fail with "Failed to save analysis" errors.

  ## Solution
  Update RLS policies to match the public access pattern used throughout the app.
  Security is maintained through:
  - Foreign key constraint to accounts table
  - Client-side wallet verification
  - Application logic enforcing ownership

  ## Changes
  1. Drop existing auth-based RLS policies
  2. Create new public RLS policies for SELECT, INSERT, and UPDATE operations
  3. Align with the pattern used in fresh_clean_database.sql for consistency

  ## Security Note
  Public RLS policies are safe here because:
  - Users authenticate via wallet signatures (not Supabase Auth)
  - Foreign key to accounts table ensures data integrity
  - Application logic validates wallet ownership before operations
